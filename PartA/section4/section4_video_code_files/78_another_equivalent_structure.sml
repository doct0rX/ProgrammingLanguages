(* the previous signature lets clients build 
 any value of type rational they
 want by exposing the Frac and Whole constructors.
 This makes it impossible to maintain invariants 
 about rationals, so we might have negative denominators,
 which some functions do not handle, 
 and print_rat may print a non-reduced fraction.  
 We fix this by making rational abstract. *)

(* as a cute trick, it is actually okay to expose
   the Whole function since no value breaks
   our invariants, and different implementations
   can still implement Whole differently.
