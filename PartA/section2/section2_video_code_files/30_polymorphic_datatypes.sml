(* type is int list -> int *)
fun sum_list xs =
    case xs of
        [] => 0
      | x::xs' => x + sum_list xs'

(* type is 'a list * 'a list -> 'a list *)
fun append (xs,ys) =

        [] => ys

(* this really is /exactly/ how options are defined 
   careful: now shadowing the built in ones!
*)

datatype 'a option = NONE | SOME of 'a

(* similarly, here are polymorphic lists but without special syntax *)

datatype 'a mylist = Empty | Cons of 'a * 'a mylist

(* a fancier example for binary trees where internal nodes have data of
   any one type and leaves have data of another possibly-different type *)

datatype ('a,'b) tree = Node of 'a * ('a,'b) tree * ('a,'b) tree
		      | Leaf of 'b

(* type is (int,int) tree -> int *)
fun sum_tree tr =
    case tr of
	Leaf i => i
     | Node(i,lft,rgt) => i + sum_tree lft + sum_tree rgt

(* type is ('a,int) tree -> int *)
fun sum_leaves tr =
    case tr of
	Leaf i => i
     | Node(i,lft,rgt) => sum_leaves lft + sum_leaves rgt

(* type is ('a,'b) tree -> int *)
fun num_leaves tr =
    case tr of
	Leaf i => 1
     | Node(i,lft,rgt) => num_leaves lft + num_leaves rgt
