(* can call is_Queen_of_Spades with any of c1, c2, c3 *)

(* and once we learn more pattern-matching, we can leave the type off
   function arguments too -- here is a teaser we cannot explain quite yet *)

    case c of

      | _ => false


(* REPL prints 
  val is_Queen_of_Spades2 = fn : suit * rank -> bool
but that is also
  val is_Queen_of_Spades2 = fn : card -> bool
*)
